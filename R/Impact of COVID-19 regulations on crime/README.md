# Impact of COVID-19 regulations on crime

This is a project that I did during my studies. In a group with four others we went on our way to analyse the 
effect of COVID-19 regulations in the Netherlands on crime.

  
Our aim was to contribute to the discussion about the consequences of the Corona pandemic and the (then) ongoing 
vaccination of the world population for health and healthcare, society, business and the economy by exploiting 
analytic methods.
